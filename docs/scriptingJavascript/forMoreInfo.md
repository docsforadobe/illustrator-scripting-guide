Several extended sample scripts are in the ``/Scripting/Sample Scripts/`` folder in your lllustrator CC 2017 installation directory.

For information about individual classes, objects, properties, methods, and parameters, as well as script samples that demonstrate how to use many of these items, see Adobe lllustrator CC 2017 Scripting Reference: JavaScript, in the ``/Scripting/Documentation/`` folder in your lllustrator CC 2017 installation directory. You also can use the Illustrator dictionary, which you access from the Object Model Viewer in the ESTK. For information on using the ExtendScript Toolkit and the Object Model Viewer, see :ref:`introduction/viewingTheObjectModel/javascript`.

If you do not understand the concepts and terms used in this chapter, read Adobe Introduction to Scripting.
