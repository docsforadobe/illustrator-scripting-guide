Dynamic Objects
################################################################################

By creating dynamic objects, you can create data-driven graphics.

In the Illustrator application, you use the Variables panel to create or edit variables like graph data, linked file, text string, and visibility, or variables whose type is not specified.

In scripting, you use the ``variable`` object to represent this type of variable.

The ``variable`` objectâ€™s ``kind`` property indicates the type of dynamic data that a ``variable`` object holds. ``Variable`` objects are document-level objects; you create them in a ``document`` object.

.. note::
  Do not confuse variable objects with scripting variables. For details on Illustrator variables, dynamic objects, and data-driven graphics, see Illustrator Help.

Datasets, which collect variables and their associated dynamic data into one object, are represented in scripting by the ``dataset`` object.

The ``dataset`` object provides methods to update and delete ``dataset`` objects in your scripts.
