# For more information

Several extended sample scripts are in the `Scripting/Sample Scripts` folder in your Illustrator installation directory.

For information about individual classes, objects, properties, commands, and parameters, as well as script samples that demonstrate how to use many of these items, see Adobe lllustrator Scripting Reference: VBScript, in the `/Scripting/Documentation/` folder in your lllustrator installation directory. You also can view the lllustrator CC 2017 dictionary from the Script Editor application; see [Viewing the VBScript object model](../introduction/viewingTheObjectModel.md#viewing-the-vbscript-object-model).

If you do not understand the concepts and terms used in this chapter, read Adobe Introduction to Scripting.
