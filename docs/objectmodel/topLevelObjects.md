Top-Level (containing) Objects
################################################################################

Use these objects to access global information about the Illustrator application or an individual document.

----

Application
================================================================================

The properties of the ``application`` object give your script access to global values, such as:

- User ``preferences``, which a user sets interactively in the Illustrator application by using the Preferences dialog (Edit > Preferences).
- System information like installed fonts (the ``text fonts`` property) and printers (the ``printer list`` property).

Also, there are properties that provide application-specific information and higher-level information about any open documents:

- Application information like the installation ``path``, ``version``, and whether Illustrator is ``visible``.
- The ``current active`` document; that is, the art canvas that is displayed and accepting user input.
- All open ``documents``.

The ``application`` object’s methods or commands allow your script to perform application-wide actions; for example:

- ``Open`` files
- ``Undo`` and ``redo`` transactions
- ``Quit`` Illustrator

----

Document
================================================================================

The ``document`` object, which your scripts can create or access through the ``application`` object, represents an art canvas or loaded Illustrator file.

The ``document`` object’s properties give you access to the document’s content; for example:

- The current ``selection``, or art objects that the user selected in the document
- All contained art objects, called ``page items``, that make up the artwork tree
- Art objects of particular types, like ``symbols`` and ``text frames``
- All ``layers`` and the currently ``active layer``

Document properties also tell you about the state of the document itself; for example:

- User settings for the document, such as ``ruler units``
- Whether the document was ``saved`` since the last alteration of content
- The ``path`` of the associated file

The document object’s methods allow your scripts to act on the document; for example:

- ``Save`` to an Illustrator file or ``save as`` the various supported file formats
- ``Activate`` or ``close`` a document
- ``Print`` the document. Your scripts can select a printer by referencing a ``print options`` object, or they can reference available printers through the application object’s ``printer list`` property.

----

Layer
================================================================================

The ``layer`` object provides access to the contents, or artwork tree, of a specific layer.

You access the ``layer`` object through the ``document`` object.

The ``layer`` object properties provide access to, or information about, the layer, such as:

- Whether the layer is ``visible`` or ``locked``.
- The layer’s ``opacity`` (overall transparency) and ``z order position`` (position in the stacking order).
- Art-creation preferences for the layer, like ``artwork knockout`` and ``blending mode.``
