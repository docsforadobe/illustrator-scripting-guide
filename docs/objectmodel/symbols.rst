Symbols
################################################################################

In Illustrator, symbols are art items that are stored in the Symbols panel.

Your scripts can create, delete, and duplicate ``symbol`` objects.

When you create ``symbol`` objects in your script, Illustrator adds them to the
Symbols panel for the target document.

A ``symbol item`` is an instance of a ``symbol`` object in a document.
Each ``symbol item`` is linked to its symbol definition, so changing the
definition of a symbol updates all instances of the symbol.

Your script can create, delete, and duplicate symbol items. Symbol items are
Illustrator art items; therefore, they can be treated in the same way as other
art items or page items.

You can rotate, resize, select, lock, hide, and perform other operations
on symbol items.
