JavaScript Object Reference
===========================

This section presents all of the object classes in the type library.

Each class listing includes the following:

- Properties of the class, including value type, read-only status, and an explanation.
- Methods for the class. Constants and value types needed by the method are shown in bold face. Required terms are shown in plain face. All items surrounded by brackets [ ] are optional.
- Notes to explain special issues.
- Sample code to help illustrate the syntax and typical workflow usage of the object class.

These examples are intended to be clear demonstrations of syntax, and do not show the best or most efficient way to construct a JavaScript script.

Error checking, for instance, is generally brief or missing.

However, the examples can be combined and expanded to make scripts with greater functionality.
