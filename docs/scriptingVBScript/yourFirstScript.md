Your first Illustrator script
################################################################################

The traditional first project in any programming language is displaying the message "Hello World!" In this example, you create a new Illustrator document, then add a text frame containing this message. Follow these steps:

1. Start any text editor (for example, Notepad).
2. Type the following code::

    Rem Hello World
    Set appRef = CreateObject("Illustrator.Application")
    Rem Create a new document and assign it to a variable
    Set documentRef = appRef.Documents.Add
    Rem Create a new text frame item and assign it to a variable
    Set sampleText = documentRef.TextFrames.Add
    Rem Set the contents and position of the TextFrame
    sampleText.Position = Array(200, 200)
    sampleText.Contents = "Hello World!"

3. Save the file as text-only in a folder of your choice, using the file extension ``.vbs``.
4. To test the script, do one of the following:

- Double-click the file.
- Start Illustrator, choose File > Scripts > Other Scripts, and navigate to and run your script file.

.. tip::
  To add the script to the Illustrator Scripts menu (File > Scripts), save the script in the Scripts folder. The script will appear on the menu the next time you start Illustrator. For details, see :ref:`introduction/executingScripts/installing`.

  In general, when you launch a VBScript script from the Scripts menu, any ``msgBox`` dialogs will not display correctly.

Adding features to "Hello World"
================================================================================

Next, we create a new script that makes changes to the Illustrator document you created with your first script. Our second script demonstrates how to:

- Get the active document.
- Get the width of the active document.
- Resize the text frame to match the documentâ€™s width.

If you already closed the Illustrator document, run your first script again to create a new document.

Follow these steps:

1. Copy the following script into your text editor, and save the file::

    Set appRef = CreateObject("Illustrator.Application")
    'Get the active document
    Set documentRef = appRef.ActiveDocument
    Set sampleText = documentRef.TextFrames(1)
    ' Resize the TextFrame item to match the document width
    sampleText.Width = documentRef.Width
    sampleText.Left = 0

2. Run the script.
