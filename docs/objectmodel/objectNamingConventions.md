# Object Naming Conventions

There is one object model for the Illustrator scripting interface, but actual object names vary slightly in the different scripting languages:

- AppleScript names are lower case, and individual words are separated by a space; for example: `graphic style`
- VBScript names are capitalized, and additional words in the name are indicated by uppercase initial letters; for example: `GraphicStyle`
- JavaScript names begin with lowercase letters, and additional words in the name are indicated by uppercase initial letters; for example: `graphicStyle`

This chapter uses generic object and property names, but you can easily apply these conventions to determine the corresponding language-specific names.

Throughout this document, names of properties, methods, and object are in a monospaced font.
