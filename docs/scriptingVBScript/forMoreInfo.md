Several extended sample scripts are in the :Scripting:Sample Scripts folder in your Illustrator CC 2017 installation directory.

For information about individual classes, objects, properties, commands, and parameters, as well as script samples that demonstrate how to use many of these items, see Adobe lllustrator CC 2017 Scripting Reference: VBScript, in the ``/Scripting/Documentation/`` folder in your lllustrator CC 2017 installation directory. You also can view the lllustrator CC 2017 dictionary from the Script Editor application; see :ref:`introduction/viewingTheObjectModel/vbscript`.

If you do not understand the concepts and terms used in this chapter, read Adobe Introduction to Scripting.
